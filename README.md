## Welcome to mt MTG Deckbuilder App

We're going to be making use of https://magicthegathering.io/ for all of our data.

Basic idea is to be able to search for specific cards and add them to 'decks' and/or 'sidebards' 

### Stack

* Node / Express backend
  https://expressjs.com/

* Vue frontend
  https://vuejs.org/

### Notes

* I'm grabbing the data via the fetch api at the moment, may want to trade out for axios
